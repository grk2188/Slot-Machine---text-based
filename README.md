# Slot-Machine---text-based

For making simple slot machine, it have 3 * 3 rows and columns
User will deposit certain amount of money.
Add deposits to their balance.
Then allow them to bet on either one/two/three lines of slot machine.
Then we need to see if they actually got any of those lines.
We then need to spin the slot machine again until we win.
We need to generate different items that are being to be in the slot machine on different reels.
Blance should be checked everytime when slot machine runs.
Remaining balance should be calculated through user wins or loose in each rows.
